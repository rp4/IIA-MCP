# International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF)

## Overview

The International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) is the conceptual framework that organizes the authoritative guidance promulgated by The IIA. The IPPF comprises three types of guidance:

## 1. Global Internal Audit Standards

Mandatory guidance consisting of:
- **Fundamental principles** for the practice of internal auditing
- **Standards** that provide a framework for performing and promoting internal auditing
- **Code of Ethics** that establishes principles and expectations for conduct

### Standards Structure
- **1000 Series**: Independence and Objectivity
- **2000 Series**: Performance standards covering planning, performing work, and communicating results

## 2. Topical Requirements

Requirements that address specific topics, sectors, or issues that supplement the Global Internal Audit Standards. These provide mandatory guidance for internal auditors working in specialized areas or facing particular circumstances.

## 3. Global Guidance

Guidance that assists internal auditors in interpreting and applying the Global Internal Audit Standards and Topical Requirements. This includes:

- **Implementation Guidance**: Helps internal auditors understand how to implement the Standards
- **Supplemental Guidance**: Addresses specific topics, sectors, or issues in more detail

## Framework Hierarchy

1. **Mandatory Guidance** (Must)
   - Global Internal Audit Standards
   - Code of Ethics
   - Topical Requirements

2. **Recommended Guidance** (Should)
   - Implementation Guidance
   - Supplemental Guidance

## Key Principles

### Integrity
Internal auditors must perform their work with honesty, diligence, and responsibility.

### Objectivity
Internal auditors must exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information.

### Confidentiality
Internal auditors must respect the value and ownership of information they receive and not disclose information without appropriate authority.

### Competency
Internal auditors must engage only in those services for which they have the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience.

## Implementation Notes

The IPPF is designed to:
- Guide the practice of internal auditing
- Provide a framework for performing and promoting internal auditing
- Establish the basis for the evaluation of internal audit performance
- Foster improved organizational processes and operations

All internal audit activities should be conducted in conformance with the Global Internal Audit Standards. When internal auditors conduct assurance or consulting activities outside their organization, they should communicate that the activity is being performed in conformance with the Global Internal Audit Standards.
