# Standard 1110 - Organizational Independence

## Description

The chief audit executive must report to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity to fulfill its responsibilities. The chief audit executive must confirm to the board, at least annually, the organizational independence of the internal audit activity.

## Implementation Notes

Organizational independence is effectively achieved when the chief audit executive reports functionally to the board. Examples of functional reporting to the board involve the board:

- Approving the internal audit charter
- Approving the risk-based internal audit plan
- Approving the internal audit budget and resource plan
- Receiving communications from the chief audit executive on the internal audit activity's performance relative to its plan and other matters
- Approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive
- Approving the remuneration of the chief audit executive
- Making appropriate inquiries of management and the chief audit executive to determine whether there are inappropriate scope or resource limitations
