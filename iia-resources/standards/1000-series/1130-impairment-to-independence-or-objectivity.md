# Standard 1130 - Impairment to Independence or Objectivity

## Description

If independence or objectivity is impaired in fact or appearance, the details of the impairment must be disclosed to appropriate parties. The nature of the disclosure will depend upon the impairment.

## Implementation Notes

Impairment to organizational independence and individual objectivity may include, but is not limited to:

- Personal or external relationships
- Scope limitations
- Resource limitations imposed by senior management or the board
- Financial or other interests
- Conflicting responsibilities
- Previous assignments
- Undue influence or pressure

The determination of appropriate parties to whom the details of an impairment to independence or objectivity must be disclosed is dependent upon the expectations of the internal audit activity's responsibilities as well as the nature of the impairment.

When independence or objectivity is impaired, internal auditors should assess whether it is appropriate to continue with the engagement and the modifications that may be necessary.
