# Standard 1120 - Individual Objectivity

## Description

Internal auditors must have an impartial, unbiased attitude and avoid any conflict of interest.

## Implementation Notes

Objectivity is an unbiased mental attitude that allows internal auditors to perform engagements in such a manner that they believe in their work product and that no quality compromises are made. Objectivity requires that internal auditors not subordinate their judgment on audit matters to others. Threats to objectivity must be managed at the individual auditor, engagement, functional, and organizational levels.

All internal auditors should make an annual declaration of their conformance with the Code of Ethics. Factors that may impact individual objectivity include:

- Financial interests, including those of immediate family
- Proscribed relationships with auditees, including those of immediate family
- Previous work assignments or future employment prospects
- Conflicting loyalties or biases
- Undue influence from others
