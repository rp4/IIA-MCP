---The International Professional Practices Framework&reg; (IPPF&reg;), which organizes The IIA&rsquo;s authoritative body of knowledge on the professional practice of internal auditing, was updated in 2024. Three components comprise the IPPF: [Global Internal Audit Standards](/en/standards/2024-standards/global-internal-audit-standards/free-documents/complete-global-internal-audit-standards/) - [**Topical Requirements**](/en/standards/2024-standards/topical-requirements/) [Global Guidance](/en/standards/2024-standards/global-guidance/) ### Global Internal Audit Standards are in full effect Internal audit functions are expected to be in conformance with the Global Internal Audit Standards TM now. The Standards guide the worldwide professional practice of internal auditing and serve as a basis for evaluating and elevating the quality of the internal audit function. The Standards are set according to a due process followed by the [International Internal Audit Standards Board](/en/standards/2024-standards/governance-process-and-due-diligence/international-internal-audit-standards-board/) and overseen by the [IPPF Oversight Council](/en/standards/2024-standards/governance-process-and-due-diligence/ippf-oversight-council/).

The 2024 IPPF includes Global Internal Audit Standards, Topical Requirements, and Global Guidance. The Global Internal Audit Standards incorporate content from the five mandatory elements of the 2017 IPPF (Mission of Internal Audit, Definition of Internal Auditing, Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, Code of Ethics, and Standards) as well as one of the recommended (nonmandatory) elements, Implementation Guidance. These elements no longer exist as separate entities. Topical Requirements will be added as a mandatory element of the IPPF and aim to enhance the consistency and quality of internal audit services related to specific risk areas. Global Guidance will continue to be a recommended element in the new IPPF, providing in-depth information about various internal audit practices and subjects.
