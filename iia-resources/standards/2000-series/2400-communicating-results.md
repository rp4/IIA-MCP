# Standard 2400 - Communicating Results

## Description

Internal auditors must communicate engagement results.

## Implementation Notes

Communications should include the engagement's objectives, scope, and results. Communications may also include background information and comparative information. Comparative information might include related findings from previous engagements or benchmarking data from other organizations.

Internal auditors are encouraged to acknowledge satisfactory performance in engagement communications. The communication may include recommendations for improvement and should acknowledge the auditee's response to the engagement conclusions and recommendations, including a timetable for implementation.

Final communication of engagement results should, where appropriate, contain the internal auditors' overall opinion and/or conclusions.
