# Standard 2200 - Engagement Planning

## Description

Internal auditors must develop and document a plan for each engagement, including the engagement's objectives, scope, timing, and resource allocations.

## Implementation Notes

Planning involves establishing the objectives, scope, timing, and resource allocation for the engagement. Planning takes into consideration:

- The objectives of the activity being reviewed and the means by which the activity controls its performance
- The significant risks to the activity, its objectives, resources, and operations and the means by which the potential impact of risk is kept to an acceptable level
- The adequacy and effectiveness of the activity's governance, risk management, and control processes compared to a relevant framework or model
- The opportunities for making significant improvements to the activity's governance, risk management, and control processes

The engagement objectives should address the risks, controls, and governance processes associated with the activities under review. Internal auditors must conduct a preliminary assessment of the risks relevant to the activity under review.
