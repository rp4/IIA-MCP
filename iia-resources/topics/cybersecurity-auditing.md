# Cybersecurity Auditing

## Overview

Cybersecurity auditing has become a critical component of internal audit activities as organizations face increasing cyber threats. This guidance helps internal auditors understand their role in evaluating cybersecurity governance, risk management, and control processes.

## Internal Audit's Role in Cybersecurity

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Governance Assessment**
   - Evaluate cybersecurity strategy and policies
   - Review board and management oversight
   - Assess organizational structure and responsibilities
   - Examine incident response governance

2. **Risk Management Evaluation**
   - Review cyber risk identification and assessment
   - Evaluate risk appetite and tolerance levels
   - Assess risk monitoring and reporting
   - Review third-party and supply chain risks

3. **Control Effectiveness Testing**
   - Test technical security controls
   - Evaluate operational controls and procedures
   - Assess security awareness and training
   - Review access management and privileged accounts

## Cybersecurity Audit Framework

### Planning Phase

#### Risk Assessment
- **Threat Landscape Analysis**: Current cyber threats facing the industry
- **Asset Inventory**: Critical systems, data, and infrastructure
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Known weaknesses and exposure points
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Potential consequences of cyber incidents

#### Scope Determination
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Networks, systems, applications
- **Data Security**: Classification, handling, and protection
- **Operational Processes**: Incident response, business continuity
- **Governance Structure**: Policies, procedures, and oversight

### Key Audit Areas
